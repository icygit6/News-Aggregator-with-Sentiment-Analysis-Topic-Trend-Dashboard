# News-Aggregator-with-Sentiment-Analysis-Topic-Trend-Dashboard
We are particularly interested in "news data analysis" and "web page visualization."  We want to develop a platform that can automatically collect and analyze news sentiment and topic trends.  We hope to use this to understand the differences in how different media outlets report on the same issues and the changes in public opinion.
